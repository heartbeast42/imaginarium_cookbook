# The official cookbook of the imaginarium and beyond
### About
This repository is literally just my cookbook. It's a place to document delicious cooking recipes to share and enjoy.

### Contributing
Recepies must be formatted according to the follong constraints
* each recipe lives in it's own file, filenames always follow snake_case naming convention
* different versions of the same recipe can live in the same file but must be distinguished
* recipes should use reasonably available ingrediants, going to specialty stores is an option but in general this is an everyday cookbook, substitutions can and should be documented if appropriate and true to the spirit of the recipe, this is just a guidline, don't overthink it too much

#### formatting the recipe
* recipe name 
   * at the top of the file in an H1 `# Recipe Name`
* ingrediants / shopping list
   * a list of ingrediants and reasonable substitutions (where appropriate)
* instructions
   * gather tools
      * pots, pans, knives, spatulas etc...
   * prep
      * what to chop and dice and coat in cornstarch
   * cooking
      * discribe the process of cooking, high or medium heat, reminders, let simmer, stir often, set a timer, be attentive etc...
